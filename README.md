Automatic update tool for **Eclipse Temurin™**, **IBM® Semeru® Open Edition**                                     [⬇ Download](#-download)<br>and **AdoptOpenJDK** releases

##

#### ℹ The AdoptOpenJDK project is moving to the Eclipse Foundation
* [As you may know](https://blog.adoptium.net/2021/04/Adoptium-to-promote-broad-range-of-compatible-OpenJDK-builds/), AdoptOpenJDK project is moving to the Eclipse Foundation and rebranding:<br>**hotspot** builds are now **Eclipse Temurin™**, while **openj9** builds have become **IBM® Semeru® Open Edition**.
* Version **2.0.4** of the updater currently still relies on `api.adoptopenjdk.net`.<br>This is a '**hotfix**' release, that brings support for Eclipse Temurin™ and IBM® Semeru® builds.<br>All other changes, such as rebranding and/or API change, will (possibly) happen in the future.

Please check [Eclipse Adoptium Slack](https://adoptium.net/slack.html) for more information about the transition or Adoptium project in general.<br>
Please do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/tushev/aojdk-updatewatcher/issues/new/choose) if you've encountered a problem with the updater or have a suggestion.




## 💡 Key ideas

* The updater tries to list all AdoptOpenJDK installations on your machine - automatically
* Every time it launches (i.e., on logon - if scheduled), it checks for updates in background
* If there are new versions, you will be notified
* **For advanced users:** It also provides a lot of manual controls - but they require some fine-tuning. Just read the tooltips, there are tons of them.


![Update Dialog](/docs/update_dialog_838.gif?raw=true)
![Config Dialog](/docs/config_dialog.png?raw=true)

When this app launches, it gets versions for your local installations of JDK/JRE (either from Windows Registry or from `release` file). Then it queries AdoptOpenJDK API to check if there are versions newer than yours. 
If there is, you will be notified. Otherwise app quits without showing any windows or alerts.

Configuration window will appear only on first run or if something goes wrong or if you have explicitly called it by the corresponding shortcut (or `-config` argument).

This app is designed to run on Windows startup. I recommend to turn on **Check for AdoptOpenJDK updates on Logon** setting in configuration. If you want another schedule, turn this on and press Edit task to configure it as desired.

## 🔃 New in v. 2.0.4:
* Fix for recent changes in Temurin that affected auto-detection:
  * Added "Eclipse Adoptium" registry root (thanks to @mcpower for #35 !)
  * Added more supported values to `IMPLEMENTOR` field in `RELEASE` file
* Updated dependencies


#### Changelog:

<details>
  <summary>New in v. 2.0.3</summary>

### 🔃 New in v. 2.0.3:
* Adds support for Eclipse Temurin™ and IBM® Semeru® Open Edition builds, especially auto-detection (#28)
* NEW! The updater detects whether the old installation was not removed during the update (can be caused by 4-th digit MSI updates, vendor change etc) and suggests to disable checking for updates for that entry.  Fixes #9 :)
* Makes **skip release** functionality more easy-to-find - this may be useful in case you encounter an update loop.
* If MSI's installation process was cancelled or interrupted, the corresponding entry will remain in 'New versions available' window
* Bugfix for version comparison algorithm (versions with the same MSI revisions could be compared incorrectly)
* Release name and vendor are now available in the UI (update dialog)
* Improved auto-detection algorithms
* Updated dependencies
* Added 'Open in Explorer' context menu:

</details>

## ℹ Requirements
Ironically, this tool is written in C# 6 + WPF, because I am not a Java developer xD
* Windows 10 x64 _(earlier versions are likely to work as well, but I did not test that. Icons may be missing in EOL versions of Windows (XP/7/8)._
* .NET Framework 4.7.2 _(must be installed beforehand)_
* At least 1280x1024 or 1366x768 screen. 

## 📩 Download
There's a built-in update mechanism. 
### 👉 [📥 Download version 2.0.4](https://github.com/tushev/aojdk-updatewatcher/releases) 👈 from here OR install using winget:

## 🛠 Installation & configuration
0. Run the downloaded installer and run the app _(internet connection highly recommended on first run :)_
1. **Turn on `Check for AdoptOpenJDK updates on Logon`**. _(If you want another schedule, turn this on and press Edit task to configure it as desired)_.
2. **Turn on automatic discovery of AdoptOpenJDK installations**.
> 👉 Please note that only MSI-installed JDKs/JREs can be discovered automatically (because only MSIs add corresponding registry keys automatically). ZIP-extracted JDKs/JREs or very old MSIs cannot be autodiscovered.
 
 **That's all!**
![First Run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tushev/aojdk-updatewatcher/master/docs/first_run_config_example_cut.gif)

##
If you don't have any JDKs/JREs installed, click on **Download and install new instance from the web** and the app will download and install them for you:

## 💡 Philosophy
* This app is silent during background checks. If there is a problem connecting to the internet or AdoptOpenJDK API does not respond, it will be silent, unless `N` *consecutive* update checks were unsuccessful *(default N=10)*
* However, it will not be silent in UI.
* I'm not going to actively develop this app, it's mostly 'fire-and-forget' thing. However, some functionality may be added in future, there's a built-in update mechanism.

## 💻 Codestyle
<details>
  <summary>📝 Codestyle notes</summary>
v.1.0: Please don't judge my coding style by this project, as I developed this app in less than a working day. It just works :)

v.2.0: The app was refactored. However, some codestyle issues still remain - for a single-person-maintained project, they are not a major issue. My top priority is app stability and robustness.

## 🔕 Known not-a-bugs

* **JAVA_HOME** value is updated when the *app is launched* (either in configuration mode or during background check). If you change JAVA_HOME value while running configuration screen, the value will not be updated in the app. However, you can close the configuration window safely: when the next background check occurs, actual value of JAVA_HOME at that time will be used 
* ⚠ Please keep in mind that if **JAVA_HOME** installation significantly changes (i.e., 8 → 11, or JRE → JDK), you should update API parameters manually _(because the app cannot decide whether this is intended or not)._<br> You can use `Detect (reset) API settings for selected` button to do it.
* If the configuration app **continiously** reminds you to turn on scheduled task (even if you opted out before), this happens because you have not either added some installations manually, or turned auto-discovery on. Once you set at least one of these, the app will consider itself as 'configured' and will remember your opt-out.
* For **manually** added installations that were released prior to Sep 16 2020, it may be not always possible to detect build number. **Thus you may miss an update**, say, from `8.0.265+1` to `8.0.265+2` - but only for manually added installations _(custom path or JAVA_HOME)_. **It is highly recommended to use automatic discovery** (which detects build numbers) for releases downloaded and installed prior to 16 September 2020.
* Unfortunately, if you install a release with partially incorrect metadata, such as Eclipse Temurin™ `8.0.302+8.1`, **you may experience an "update loop"**. This is not a bug in **Update Watcher**, this is caused by a bug in release metadata.<br>✔ **SOLUTION:** "skip" the  `8.0.302+8.1` release **after you've installed it** - so no further suggestions for updating to  `8.0.302+8.1` will appear. Please see https://github.com/tushev/aojdk-updatewatcher/wiki/Skipping-releases on how to do it.
